        Its time you men woke up build yourselves or
         else you gonna end up in the streets all alone with none on your side</h1></b>
    <h2 style="background-color: azure;"> goes to that man there outside who
         is either a simp, unconfident or cant get a woman of his dreams</h2>
<p>First of all their aint any woman out their who is ment to be yours bro, you gat to get out there and get her. Second you are the prize king and women know that. Dont hesitate approaching that fine girl you see consider doing her a favour. Women love validation, they look forward to being approached by men, so king whenever you see that fine girl wear your biggest smile with pride and get to that girl remembering you are the prize king!</p>
<br>
<P>Now how did we arrive at that point where you men dont have even the tiniest bit of confidence?
    First, lets talk about men's life's, most of them are fake,,,i.e porn is fake ,junk food is just
    fake food, drugs is fake dopamine, social media is fake friendship, video games are fake achievements.
    This is how we men are fake, living fake lives and getting comfortable in them. Kings, this is your 
    life choose the real things, go for real achievements.Remember life is too short for fake stuff.

</P>
<p> Women are born with vakue us men we create our own value so men invest in yourselves create confidence
    , hit the gym, dress well smell nice, live your life and dont for once ever compare yourself with
    any girl coz you two can never be of the same value you are definatelly great coz you are the price
    and never push yourself down on any level lower than yours to impress any girl. Chase your personal
    development and girls will chase you.
</p>
<p>One thing that i always know is that the boychild is his own enemy. Women would rather focus on their
    looks and physical shape rather than focus on their self development.WHY????This is because they know
    the society is filled with weak, simps and feminine men.They know that for just the fact that they 
    are girls they are entitled to a luxurious life fully sponsored by you men. All they have to do is to sexualize
     themselves and they will recieve tons of dms from desparate men. They know the lustfulness of you men 
     is their golden tickets to richness and so they weaponize the mans weakness and manipulate him to reach the 
     promised land which of course is the mans pocket. Even if the men know they dont mind or dont care and keep on
     validating these women making them think that men should pay them just because of being or because of looking beautiful
     or existing. I REPEAT, MEN ARE THE PROBLEM NOT WOMEN. If men will not change i fear in decades to come
     we will have a generation of very weak men who wount be able to form any families or make any meaningful changes in the society
